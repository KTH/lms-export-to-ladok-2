      <h1>KTH Transfer to Ladok</h1>
      <p>
        This application has been developed with the intent to enable a secure digital transfer of grades from Canvas Gradebook to
        Ladok and hopefully also reduce the amount of manual grade administration.</p>
      <h2>How do I start using the application?</h2>
      <p>If you have not used this application before, please read the instructions for Canvas Gradebook and this
        application in <a href="https://kth.instructure.com/courses/1/pages/step-7-information-grades" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canvas@KTH</a>
        carefully. Click the button at the bottom of this page to launch the application.</p>
      <h2>Important to notice</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The application can transfer letter grades from a column in Canvas Gradebook to draft status for a Ladok
          module (i.e. not the final grade of the course). In the next step, you will have to select which column in
          Canvas Gradebook that should be transferred to which Ladok module. Make sure that the column in Canvas
          Gradebook
          contains the allowed letter grades for the Ladok module.</li>
        <li>Grades that have been marked as ready and certified will not be transferred to Ladok, except for F or Fx. Be
          wary when you want to transfer grades for the second time (e.g. after a re-exam) for a Ladok module.</li>
        <li>
          Transfer of final grades is currently not supported.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer of examination points is currently not supported.
        </li>
