# Certificate
This app needs a valid certificate from Ladok since it uploads grades to Ladok. When such a certificate has been downloaded, do the following to generate a base 64 encoded string from the certificate:

    openssl pkcs12 -export -out <pfxname>.pfx -inkey <keyname>@KTH.key -in <certname>@KTH.crt
    base64 -i <pfxname>.pfx
Example:

    openssl pkcs12 -export -out kth.emilsten.pfx -inkey emilsten@KTH.key -in emilsten@KTH.crt
    base64 -i kth.emilsten.pfx

_Then remove all of the newlines of the newly created base 64 string_ and add this string to the .env file in the `LADOK_API_PFX_BASE64` environment variable.

# Add reporter rights
After the app is configured to use the Ladok certificate, _the user has to be reporter in all of the subaccounts/schools in Ladok_. This is necessary to let the system user report grades in Ladok.
To do this, run the script [add-reporter](https://github.com/KTH/lms-scripts/tree/master/add-reporter).
